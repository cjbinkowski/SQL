#This database and analysis is created to help observe how each player performs over the season. Points are determined by rules followed by a family competition where a family member picks a player for each series and collects points with the player. Hopefully this will help get me above last place, which is where I ranked last season.
  

##Creation of data tables
CREATE TABLE Players
(ID integer Primary Key,
First_Name text NOT NULL,
Last_Name text NOT NULL);

CREATE TABLE Games
(Game_ID integer PRIMARY KEY,
Opponent text NOT NULL,
Pitcher_Name text NOT NULL,
Pitcher_Arm text NOT NULL,
Date text);

CREATE TABLE Result
(Game_ID integer NOT NULL,
Player_ID integer NOT NULL,
Points integer NOT NULL,
First text,
Second text,
Third text,
Fourth text,
Fifth text) ;
/* First, etc., refer to what was done at each at bat. Columns will often have NULL values due to variation in at bats per game*/


ALTER TABLE Results ADD COLUMN RBIs integer DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE Results ADD COLUMN Runs integer DEFAULT 0;
/* These columns were overlooked when first creating the table so they were just added on afterwards. Setting Default to 0 means there will always be a value. Otherwise when no Runs or RBIs were achieved, setting to 0 might be forgotten.*/
